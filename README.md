# 📸 Revio

**Revio** is a full-stack social media platform for car enthusiasts to discover, share, and compete through real-world supercar sightings.

Built with a modern Android client (Jetpack Compose) and a custom Ktor backend, the project demonstrates scalable architecture, secure authentication, cloud storage integration, and clean separation of concerns.

---

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

Revio follows a modular, layered architecture designed for scalability and maintainability.

### System Components

- 📱 Android Client (Kotlin + Jetpack Compose)
- 🌐 REST API (Ktor)
- 🗄 PostgreSQL Database
- ☁️ AWS S3 (image storage)
- 🔐 JWT Authentication (Access + Refresh Tokens)
- 🐳 Docker (local development & testing)

---

## 🏗 Backend Architecture

The backend is structured into clear layers:

- **Routing Layer** – Defines HTTP endpoints
- **Repository Layer** – Business logic abstraction
- **DAO Layer** – Database operations
- **DTO Layer** – Safe data transfer models
- **Model Layer** – Core domain entities
- **Security Module** – JWT + Google OAuth integration

This separation ensures:

- Testability
- Clean responsibility boundaries
- Easier debugging
- Scalability for future features

---

## 📱 Android Architecture

The Android app follows modern best practices:

- **Kotlin**
- **Jetpack Compose**
- **MVVM Architecture**
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**
- **ViewModel + State Management**
- **Navigation Compose**
- **Material Design 3**
- Secure JWT storage using Android Keystore
